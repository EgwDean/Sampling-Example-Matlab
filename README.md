# Sampling-Example-Matlab
This is a simple MatLab script which simulates sampling of a signal with a varying sampling frequency. The signal to be simulated is represented as a red dot that moves around the circumference of a circle. Another green dot is moving around the circle with the sampling frequency. Each time the green dot makes a full rotation, a sample is taken.
